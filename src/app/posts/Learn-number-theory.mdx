To understand these concepts, you just need basic arithmetic knowledge, typically covered up to 10th-grade mathematics.

I'll start straight away by introducing the problem. First, the easier version, and then we'll move to the harder version, which is just the easier version with increased constraints.

**Problem Statement** – Given an array $A$ of size $N$ and a positive integer $M$,
perform these steps:

- First, create array $B$ such that $B_i = A_i \times M!$ ($M!$ denotes the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of $M$).
- Then, for each element in array $B$, calculate $F(B_i)$, where $F(x)$ represents the number of divisors of $x$.

Since these values can be large, output each $F(B_i) \bmod (1e9+7)$.

- Output $N$ space-separated integers representing $F(B_i) \bmod (1e9+7)$.

### Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 1e5$
- $1 \leq M \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 1e5$

What's the first thing that comes to your mind after reading the problem statement?
Naturally, it might be that we can multiply $M!$ with each $A_i$, factorize it, and count the number of divisors. Technically, that's the core idea, but there are a few twists..

Let's point out a few things:

- How will you calculate $M!$ as the maximum value $M$ can take is 100? That's a very, very huge value. (For reference, $20! = 2432902008176640000$)
- How will you factorize each number?
- How do you count the number of divisors?

Let's make one thing clear: we can never calculate $M!$ directly, as we'd need supercomputers for that and still wouldn't be able to compute it. So, how can one solve this problem?

---

**Let's start from the basics:**

- What is a divisor of a number $x$?

If $x$ is **divisible by** $d$ without leaving a remainder, then $d$ is called a **divisor of $x$**. Factor and divisor both mean the same thing.

- What is **Factorization** and what is **Prime Factorization**?

**Factorization** is the process of breaking down a number into a product of other numbers, called **factors**, which when multiplied together give the original number.
_For example:_ $12=2\times2\times3$

**Prime factorization** is a special kind of factorization where the number is expressed as a product of **prime numbers** only.
_For example:_ $36 = 2^{2} \times 3^{2}$

- **How to find all divisors of a number $x$?**
  We can iterate from $1$ to $x$ and check if $x$ is divisible by that number or not. But this method is usually not feasible because we sometimes deal with very big numbers like $1e9$, where the time complexity will reach $O(N)$.

- **How can we improve time complexity then?**

  If we check carefully:

- The **smallest factor** of any number $x$ (greater than 1 and even) will always be 2.
- The **largest factor**, excluding $x$ itself, will always be at most $\frac{x}{2}$.
- Great, we've reduced time complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(N/2)$.

  **_For example:_**  
  Take 48: its largest factor is 24. After that, no number (other than 48 itself) divides it evenly.

- Another important point: **factors always appear in pairs**.

  Let's look at 48 again. Its factor pairs are:

  $$
  (2, 24),\ (3, 16),\ (4, 12),\ (6, 8),\ (8, 6),\ (12, 4),\ (16, 3),\ (24, 2)
  $$

  - Notice that once the factor on the left side of the pair exceeds $\sqrt{48}$, the pair starts to repeat in reverse.
  - So instead of checking up to $x/2$, we only need to check up to $\sqrt{x}$.

Below is a code snippet to find all divisors of a number in C++:

```cpp
void all_divisors(int num) {
    vector<int> ans;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) {
            ans.push_back(i);
            if (num / i != i) ans.push_back(num / i);
        }
    }
}
```

- I'll also share a code snippet for how to find the prime factorization of a number by tweaking the above method:

```cpp
map<long long, int> primeFactorize(long long n) {
    map<long long, int> factors;

    // Divide by 2 until it's odd
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
        factors[2]++;
        n /= 2;
    }

    // Try odd divisors from 3 up to sqrt(n)
    for (long long i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
        while (n % i == 0) {
            factors[i]++;
            n /= i;
        }
    }

    // If n is still greater than 1, it's a prime
    if (n > 1) {
        factors[n]++;
    }

    return factors;
}
```

The time complexity of this prime factorization is $O(\sqrt{N})$ only.

Can we improve it?
Yes, by factorization using the _Sieve of Eratosthenes_.

**What is the _Sieve of Eratosthenes_?**
Sometimes, while dealing with some problems, we have to check if a number is prime or not. One way is to find all its divisors using the above-mentioned method. But this method is useful in cases with queries, due to its time complexity being $O(\sqrt{N})$. So, we use the Sieve of Eratosthenes method for checking if a number is prime or not in $O(1)$.

```cpp
// For finding if a number is prime or not
void sieve() {
    vector<int> primes(1e7 + 1, 1); // mark all nums as 1
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= 1e7 + 1; i++) {
        if (primes[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= 1e7 + 1; j += i) {
                primes[j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
// Time Complexity: O(N*log(log(N)))
```

The algorithm itself is pretty simple: we mark all numbers as _prime_ (1) initially. Then, for every number, we mark its multiples as _not prime_ (0).
Why is its time complexity $O(N \log \log N)$? It's kind of tricky to prove, but to give a simple gist:

- We iterate from $2$ to $N$. That's $O(N)$ time complexity.
- For each number $i$, we iterate over its multiples.
- In $N$, there are $N/i$ multiples of $i$, so basically the number of times the loop runs is
  $$
  \frac{N}{2} + \frac{N}{3} + \frac{N}{4} + \cdots + \frac{N}{N}
  $$
  and
  $$
  N \times \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{N}\right)
  $$
- This series is called the Harmonic Series:

  $$
  H_n = \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{N}\right)
  $$

- And the sum over primes is:
  $$
  \sum_{p = 1}^{N} \frac{1}{p} \approx \log \log N
  $$
  Hence, the Sieve's time complexity is $O(N \log \log N)$.

Okay, we know the Sieve of Eratosthenes now, but we still don't know how to use it for prime factorization.

- Well, there is a pretty neat trick. We'll modify the Sieve array into an SPF array, which is basically the _smallest prime factor_ of a number.
- Now, to find the prime factorization of a number $x$, we'll do the following steps:
  - Divide $x$ by $lpf[x]$, which is basically its lowest prime factor.
  - Now, repeat step 1 again for $(x/lpf[x])$, which is the new number we obtained after dividing $x$ by $lpf[x]$.
  - Keep doing this process until the number becomes 1.
  - At most, we can divide a number $\log_2(X)$ times. Hence, the prime factorization time complexity decreases significantly.

```cpp
// 1) Fill Lowest Prime Factor of number array
// 2) For a number X, keep dividing by itself by lpf[X] and replacing X = X / lpf[X]

vector<int> lpf(N + 1, 1);
for (int i = 2; i <= 1e7 + 1; i++) {
    if (lpf[i] == 1) {
        lpf[i] = i;
        for (int j = i * i; j <= 1e7 + 1; j += i) {
            lpf[j] = i;
        }
    }
}

// now to factorize
while (num != 1) {
    cout << lpf[num] << " ";
    num /= lpf[num];
}
```

Before going back to the problem again, I'd like to introduce **Modular Arithmetic**.

- $a \% b$ = remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$
- $a \% b$ is **always less than** $b$, i.e., $0 \leq a \% b \leq b-1$
- $\%$ is called the **modulus operator** and $a \% b$ is called **$a$ modulo $b$**.
- It is generally used when we want to wrap a number around some fixed constraint (see point number 2).
- Usually, when dealing with big numbers and calculations, we are told to return $ans \% (1e9 + 7)$, with $1e9 + 7$ being a prime.
- Below are some common modulus arithmetic properties:
  - _No. of mods = Total No. of Variables + Total No. of Operations (similar for multiplication)_
  - $a + b = (a \% m + b \% m) \% m$
  - $a + b + c = ((a \% m + b \% m) \% m + c \% m) \% m$
  - for subtracttion, use $(a - b + m) \% m$ to handle negatives.
- But for division, we do:

  - $(a / b) \bmod m = (a \cdot b^{-1}) \bmod m$

- $b^{-1}$ is the **multiplicative inverse** of $b$ modulo $m$

  - i.e., $(b \cdot x) \bmod m = 1$, where $x$ is the inverse of $b$

- To calculate the multiplicative inverse when $m$ is prime, we use **Fermat's Little Theorem**:

  - If $p$ is a prime and $b \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ (i.e., $b$ is not divisible by $p$), then:
    $b^{p - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \quad$(i.e., raising $b$ to the power $p-1$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by $p$)

  - Multiply both sides by $b^{-1}$:

    $$
    b^{p - 2} \equiv b^{-1} \mod p
    $$

  - So,
    $$
    b^{-1} \mod p = b^{p - 2} \mod p
    $$

- Thus, for modular division:
  $$
  \frac{a}{b} \mod p = a \cdot b^{p - 2} \mod p
  $$
- Hence, in simple words, the multiplicative inverse of a number $b$:
  - $b^{-1} \mod p = b^{p-2} \mod p$
- Now, you might be thinking: how do we calculate $b$ raised to the power $p-2$? Since we generally use $1e9+7$ as $p$, let me introduce another topic: **Binary Exponentiation**, which lets us calculate powers in $O(\log p)$ time complexity.
  - $x^{n} = x * x * x * \cdots * x$ (i.e., $x$ multiplied $n$ times)
  - If we try to do this using a general for loop, it's going to take $O(N)$ time complexity, which is clearly not feasible. Since $N$ we're dealing with here is $(1e9 + 7)$.
- We're going to make a simple optimization to significantly reduce the time complexity:

  - $x^{n} = (x \times x)^{n/2} = (x^{2})^{n/2}$ (by the basic exponent rule, $(x^{a})^{b} = x^{a \cdot b}$)
  - Thus, if we repeatedly divide $n$ by $2$ and square $x$ at each step, we can achieve a logarithmic time complexity.

- More specifically:
  - If $n$ is **even**, then $x^{n} = (x^{2})^{n/2}$
  - If $n$ is **odd**, then $x^{n} = x \times x^{n - 1}$, and we reduce the problem by decreasing $n$ by 1.

Below is a C++ implementation of the same:

```cpp
// bin_pow(x, n) = x^n
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int bin_pow(int base, int exp) {
    int ans = 1;
    base %= mod; // Handle base larger than mod

    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2 == 1) {
            ans = (1LL * ans * base) % mod;
        }
        base = (1LL * base * base) % mod;
        exp /= 2;
    }

    return ans;
}
```

- We're always taking mod at each multiplication. Thus, the answer will always be less than $(1e9+7)$ even for $b^{p-2}$ where $p=1e9+7$ itself.

Great, now we've finished with most of the prerequisites for the problem. So, let's go back to the problem again.

- We need to find the number of divisors of $B_i$, where $B_i = A_i * M!$
- After learning all these concepts above, we get the idea that if we can obtain the prime factorization of $B_i$, then we can proceed to the solution.
- What exactly do we do?

  - Let's assume the prime factorization of $B_i$:

    $$
    B_i = P_1^{x} \times P_2^{y} \times P_3^{z} \cdots
    $$

    where $P_1, P_2, P_3, \cdots$ are the prime factors of $B_i$ and $x, y, z, \cdots$ are the powers of each of them, respectively.

  - Each prime factor $P^k$ contributes $k + 1$ choices (from $P^0$ to $P^k$) in a divisor.  
    So, by the **multiplication principle**, the total number of divisors is: _Number of divisors of $B_i = (x+1)\times(y+1)\times(z+1)\cdots$_

Great! We've almost reached the solution. We just need to _prime factorize_ $M! * A_i$.

- Now, here I introduce the last concept for this blog: **Legendre's formula – Largest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$**
  - To find the highest power of a prime $p$ that divides $n!$, we count how often $p$ appears in the factorization.
  - Multiples of $p$ contribute one factor: $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor$  
    Multiples of $p^2$ contribute an extra: $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor$  
    Multiples of $p^3$ contribute yet another: $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor$  
    ... and so on, until $p^k > n$.
  - Therefore, **Legendre's Formula:** $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor$

Great! We now know how to factorize $M!$.
Let's formulate our solution!

1.  - Read integers `n` (size of array) and `M` (factorial base).
    - Read array `v` of size `n` — these are the $A_i$ values.
    - Set up a sieve to generate all **primes up to $M$**.
2.  Precompute prime powers in $M!$ using **Legendre's Formula** and store them in a map $m[p] = \text{power}$.
    Power of $p = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{M}{p^i} \right\rfloor$
3.  - For each $v[i]$, compute its **prime factorization** using trial division.
    - Store the prime factors and their counts in a local map `fact`.
    - For each number $v[i]$, **merge** its prime factors with the prime factors of $M!$.
4.  Now, calculate the final answer for each $v[i]$ by looping through the `fact` map and
    _Number of divisors_ $= (x_1+1)(x_2+1)\dots$
    Time Complexity: $O(M \log \log M)$ for Sieve + $O(M)$ for Legendre + $O(n \cdot (\sqrt{A} + \frac{M}{\log M}))$ for root computation, merging, and calculating the final result.

Below is a code snippet with comments implementing the above steps:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
typedef long long ll;
typedef long double ld;
const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;
const ll INF = 1e18;
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using namespace std;

// Function to multiply two numbers under modulo
ll mul(ll x, ll y) {
    x %= mod;
    y %= mod;
    return (x * y) % mod;
}

// Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to 'n'
void sieve(ll n, vector<ll> &primes) {
    vector<ll> p(n + 1, 1);  // Initialize all numbers as prime
    for (ll i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (p[i]) {
            for (ll j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
                p[j] = 0;  // Mark non-primes
            }
        }
    }
    for (ll i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (p[i]) primes.push_back(i);  // Collect all prime numbers
    }
}

int main() {
    map<ll, ll> m;  // To store power of each prime in M!
    ll n, M;
    cin >> n >> M;

    vector<ll> v(n), primes;
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> v[i];

    // Step 1: Compute all primes up to M
    sieve(M, primes);

    // Step 2: Use Legendre's formula to calculate the power of each prime in M!
    for (auto e : primes) {
        ll num = M, res = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            num /= e;
            res += num;  // Accumulate number of times 'e' divides M!
        }
        m[e] = res;
    }

    // Step 3: Process each A[i] in the array
    for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        map<ll, ll> fact;

        // Step 4: Prime factorize A[i] using trial division
        for (ll j = 2; j * j <= v[i]; j++) {
            ll ct = 0;
            while (v[i] % j == 0) {
                v[i] /= j;
                ct++;
            }
            if (ct > 0) fact[j] = ct;
        }

        // If v[i] itself is a prime > sqrt(original v[i])
        if (v[i] > 1) fact[v[i]] = 1;

        // Step 5: Merge the factorization of A[i] with M! (add exponents)
        for (auto e : m) {
            fact[e.first] += e.second;
        }

        // Step 6: Compute number of divisors using formula:
        // (a1+1)*(a2+1)*...(ak+1), where ai is exponent of prime
        ll ans = 1;
        for (auto e : fact) {
            ll x = e.second + 1;
            ans = (ans * x) % mod;
        }

        cout << ans << " ";
    }
}
```

Wow, we solved this problem! But an important thing to note here is that in Legendre's Formula calculation, $M$ can be $100$ at max, thus $O(M)$ makes sense. But if we increase $M$ to $1e7$, the above solution will give TLE.

Below are the modified constraints:

- $1 \leq N \leq 1e5$
- $1 \leq M \leq 1e7$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 1e7$

Now, how can we optimize it further for big values of $M$ and $A_i$?

- To handle big values of $A_i$, we can use factorization using Sieve, which is logarithmic time complexity. To do this, we'll modify the Sieve array to an $LPF$ array, where $LPF_i$ is the lowest prime factor of the $i$-th number. And if $LPF_i = i$, then $i$ is a prime.
- And to handle large values of $M$, we'll define a new array $SPF$ where $SPF_i$ is the power the $i$-th number carries.
- To factorize $M!$ now, we'll iterate over $2$ to $M$ and for each value, we'll prime factorize it and store it in the $SPF$ array.
  Below is a code snippet for the same:

```cpp
for (ll i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
    ll x = i;
    while (x > 1) {
        spf[lpf[x]]++; // Increment power of prime
        x /= lpf[x];
    }
}
```

- Now that we've prime factorization of $M!$, we'll calculate the result for $M!$ only, i.e., $(p_1+1)*(p_2+1)\dots$

```cpp
ll ans = 1;
for (auto e : primes) {
    ans = mul(ans, spf[e] + 1); // Using formula (a+1)(b+1)... where a,b are exponents
}
```

- Now, we'll prime factorize each $A_i$ using Sieve and store it in a _Factor_ map. $Factor[x] = p$, where $p$ is the power of $x$ in $A[i]$
- For the final result for each $A_i$, we will iterate through the _Factor_ map and $ans = ans * (p_x + spf[x] + 1) / (spf[x] + 1)$
  - where $p_x$ is the power of $x$ in $A[i]$
  - $x$ is the factor of $A[i]$
  - Initially, $ans$ is the number of divisors of $M!$ only. To update it for each $A_i$, we'll remove the contribution of $x$ from $ans$ (i.e., divide $ans$ by $spf[x] + 1$) and add the joint contribution of $x$ from $A_i$ and $M!$ both to $ans$ (i.e., multiply $ans$ with $p_x + spf[x] + 1$)
  - To remove contributions, we multiply $ans$ with the multiplicative inverse of $(spf[x] + 1)$ because we can't divide directly when modular arithmetic is involved. And to compute the multiplicative inverse, we calculate $(spf[i] + 1)^{mod -2}$ where $mod = 1e9+7$.

            x /= lpf[x];
        }
    }

    // STEP 5: Calculate number of divisors of M! using its prime factorization
    ll ans = 1;
    for (auto e : primes) {
        ans = mul(ans, spf[e] + 1); // Using formula (a+1)(b+1)... where a,b are exponents
    }

    // STEP 6: For each A[i], factorize and adjust number of divisors accordingly
    for (auto e : v) {
        map<ll, ll> fact;
        factorize(e, fact); // Factorize A[i]

        ll res = ans;
        for (auto &[x, p] : fact) {
            // Multiply with (f1 + m1 + 1), where:
            // f1 = exponent of x in A[i], m1 = exponent of x in M!
            res = mul(res, p + spf[x] + 1);

            // Divide by (m1 + 1) using modular inverse
            res = mul(res, bin_pow(spf[x] + 1, mod - 2, mod));
        }
        cout << res << " ";
    }
}
```

That was heavy. So, I'll summarize what we've learned in this blog:

### **Problem Overview**

Given:

- Array $A$ of size $N$
- Integer $M$

Define $B_i = A_i \times M!$, and compute $F(B_i)$ — the number of divisors of $B_i$.

Return $F(B_i) \bmod (10^9 + 7)$ for all $i$.

---

**Core Concepts Covered**

### 1. **Divisors & Factorization**

- **Divisor**: $d$ divides $x$ if $x \bmod d = 0$
- **Factorization**: Writing $x$ as a product of smaller numbers
- **Prime Factorization**: Decompose into prime numbers only, e.g., $36 = 2^2 \times 3^2$
- **Divisors from Prime Factors**:
  - If $x = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \dots$, then number of divisors = $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\dots$

### 2. **Efficient Factorization**

- **Naive**: Try all $i$ from $1$ to $x$ — $O(N)$
- **Optimized**: Iterate up to $\sqrt{x}$ — $O(\sqrt{N})$
- **Further**: Use **Sieve of Eratosthenes** and **LPF (Lowest Prime Factor)** for $O(\log N)$ factorization

### 3. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**

- Finds all primes $\leq N$ in $O(N \log \log N)$
- Marks all multiples of each prime as composite
- Can be modified to store **Smallest Prime Factor (SPF)** or **LPF**

### 4. **Prime Factorization Using LPF Array**

- Precompute LPF via Sieve
- For number $x$: keep dividing by `lpf[x]` to extract prime factors
- Time Complexity: $O(\log x)$

### 5. **Legendre's Formula**

- Power of a prime $p$ in $M!$ is:

  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{M}{p^i} \right\rfloor
  $$

- Helps factorize $M!$ without explicitly computing it

### 6. **Modular Arithmetic**

- Common modulus used: $10^9 + 7$ (a prime)
- Key properties:
  - $(a + b) \bmod m = (a \bmod m + b \bmod m) \bmod m$
  - $(a \cdot b) \bmod m = (a \bmod m \cdot b \bmod m) \bmod m$
- **Modular Inverse**:
  - When dividing under modulo, use: $a / b \bmod m = a \cdot b^{-1} \bmod m$
  - Compute inverse via Fermat's Little Theorem (when $m$ is prime):
    $$
    b^{-1} \bmod m = b^{m - 2} \bmod m
    $$

### 7. **Binary Exponentiation**

- Compute $x^n \bmod m$ in $O(\log n)$
- If $n$ is even: $x^n = (x^2)^{n/2}$
- If $n$ is odd: $x^n = x \cdot x^{n - 1}$

---

### 8. **Final Algorithm Summary**

#### Case 1: $M \leq 100$

- Precompute prime powers in $M!$ using **Legendre's Formula**
- Factorize each $A_i$ using trial division
- Merge both factorizations to get $B_i$
- Compute number of divisors

#### Case 2: $M, A_i \leq 10^7$

- Use **Sieve with LPF** to factorize all $A_i$
- Factorize $M!$ by factorizing each number from $1$ to $M$
- Precompute number of divisors for $M!$ as base answer
- For each $A_i$, adjust divisor count using:

  $$
  \text{new\_ans} = \text{base} \cdot \frac{p_x + \text{spf}[x] + 1}{\text{spf}[x] + 1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)
  $$

- Use **modular inverse** for division

### Wrapping Up

We started with what looked like a simple number theory problem, but along the way, we learned many important concepts:

- **Divisors and Prime Factorization**
- **Efficient Prime Generation using Sieve of Eratosthenes**
- **Legendre's Formula for factorial prime powers**
- **Modular Arithmetic and Modular Inverses**
- **Binary Exponentiation for fast power computations**
- **Optimized Factorization using SPF/LPF arrays**

And most importantly — how to **combine them all smartly** to solve a tough problem efficiently, even with large constraints.

This single problem gave us the chance to explore nearly every number theory concept you'll need for competitive programming. If you understood everything here, congratulations! You've taken a huge leap forward.
